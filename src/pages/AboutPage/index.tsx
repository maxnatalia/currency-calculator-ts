      <h3>About Author</h3>
      <p className="section__paragraph">
        Hello there! My name is Natalia, and I am truly passionate about
        animals. In fact, I share my home with a delightful dog and a charming
        trio of parrots, creating a lively and vibrant atmosphere. 🐶🦜🐦🐦
      </p>
      <p className="section__paragraph">
        Apart from my love for animals, I have also discovered a deep
        fascination for programming. It's a field that allows me to exercise my
        creativity, problem-solving skills, and logical thinking, all while
        exploring the endless possibilities of technology. Over time, I have
        gained substantial knowledge in various programming techniques,
        continuously honing my skills and staying up to date with the latest
        advancements.
      </p>
      <p className="section__paragraph">
        But my interests don't end there! When I'm not immersed in programming,
        you'll find me nurturing my beloved collection of plants. There's
        something incredibly gratifying about caring for these living organisms
        and witnessing their growth and beauty firsthand. It brings me joy and
        helps me find balance and tranquility in my daily life.
      </p>
      <p className="section__paragraph">
        As I continue on my journey, I'm always eager to expand my knowledge
        further and embrace new challenges. The world of programming is
        ever-evolving, and I strive to stay at the forefront, continually
        learning and mastering new technologies and methodologies.
